      <hr />
      <p>
        Laoag City, which was then the biggest center of population, was made the capital of Ilocos Norte. Though Laoag
        was converted into a city in 1965 through a plebiscite, leaving its municipal status, it remained the capital of
        Ilocos Norte. The first city mayor was Eulalio F. Siazon. Its name is said to come from an Ilocano term, "lawag"
        which means light or brightness. The city is also popularly known as the "Sunshine City" that has clear
        atmosphere with beautiful, blue skyline. As of 2015, Laoag City has a total population of 111,125.

      <h2>Aurora Park</h2>
      <p>Aurora Park is situated at the center surrounded by the St. William Cathedral Church, Laoag City Hall, Marcos
        Hall of
        Justice, Ilocos Norte Provincial Capitol and the Sinking Bell Tower. Laoag City, which was then the biggest

      <h2>Bell Tower</h2>
      <p>The bell tower was presumably built after the 1707 earthquake. It has withstood several minor earthquakes since
        completion, thus earning membership to the “Earthquake Baroque” style label by architecture scholars, along with
        several
        churches across the Philippines and Guatemala</p>

      <h2>Ilocos Norte Capitol</h2>
      <p>Established in 1918, the provincial capitol serves as the seat of the government of Ilocos Norte and
        continually brings
        quality services and assistance to the Ilokanos.
        With rich story of Ilokano, the capitol building speaks of imperial dominance as
        its style is greatly inspired by American colonial structures.</p>

      <p>The Kalesa is a horse-drawn box-like carriage on two wheels. It has been around since the Spanish times in the
        Philippines. The Ilocos Norte kalesa differs from its cousins in other parts of the country in that two pairs of
        passengers sit opposite each other, face to face.</p>

      <h2>What is Pakbet?</h2>
      <p>PINAKBET (pinakebbet) is the Ilocano word for " shriveled or shrunk." The word has been applied to the dish
        because the
        vegetables, after simmering in the diluted fish paste, shrivel and shrink. Certainly there are versions of the
        dish in
        other provinces but the Ilocano variety is acknowledged to be the original.</p>

      <h2>Recipe</h2>
      <p>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until tender,
        about 5
        minutes. Stir in the pork and cook until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the shrimp into the mixture;
        season
        with salt and pepper. Continue cooking until the shrimp turn pink, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato to the pot,
        cover,
        and let cook 5 minutes. Stir the okra, green beans, eggplant, and bitter melon into the mixture; cover, and cook
        until
        the vegetables are all soft to the touch, about 10 minutes more. Serve hot.</p>
